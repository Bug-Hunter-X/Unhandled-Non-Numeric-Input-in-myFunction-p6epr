This repository contains a MATLAB function, myFunction, that exhibits unexpected behavior when provided with non-numeric input. The function is intended to double the input value, but it does not perform error handling for cases where the input is not a number. This leads to runtime errors and incorrect results.  The bugSolution.m file provides a corrected version of the function with improved error handling.
